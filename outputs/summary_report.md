# Sales Forecasting Progress Report

This report visualizes the results of our sales forecasting models, explaining which model we chose, how reliable it is, and what the future sales look like.

## 1. Which model is the most accurate?

We tested several models and compared their **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**. A lower error means the model is better at matching the actual sales pattern.

*The chart above shows that we selected the model with the lowest error rate for our forecasts.*

## 2. Model Reliability Check

Before attempting to predict the future, we verified the model's performance on past test data.

*   *Observation*: The model closely follows the actual sales trends, capturing peaks and dips effectively.
