    └── daily_sales_features.csv  # Feature-engineered dataset for ML models
```

## Data Files

### processed/daily_sales_simple.csv
- **Size**: ~31 KB
- **Rows**: ~1,458 (4 years of daily data)
- **Columns**: Order Date, Sales
- **Purpose**: Time series data for ARIMA/SARIMA models
- **Generated by**: `02_data_preparation.ipynb`

### processed/daily_sales_features.csv
- **Size**: ~369 KB  
- **Rows**: ~1,458
- **Columns**: 22 features including:
  - Date features (year, month, day, quarter, etc.)
  - Lag features (previous 7, 14, 30 days)
  - Rolling statistics (7-day, 30-day averages)
  - Sales (target variable)
- **Purpose**: Feature-rich dataset for machine learning models
- **Generated by**: `02_data_preparation.ipynb`

## Data Source

The original dataset should be downloaded from:
**Kaggle Superstore Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final

Place the downloaded `Sample - Superstore.csv` file in the `data/raw/` directory.

## Generating Processed Data

If you need to regenerate the processed data files:

1. Download the raw dataset (see above)
2. Run `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` to understand the data
3. Run `notebooks/02_data_preparation.ipynb` to generate processed files

The processed files will be automatically created in `data/processed/`.

## Data Quality

- **Missing Values**: Handled in preprocessing
- **Date Range**: 2014-01-03 to 2017-12-30 (4 years)
- **Outliers**: Identified and documented in exploration notebook
- **Duplicates**: Removed during preprocessing

## Notes

- The processed data files are included in the repository for convenience
- Raw data is excluded via `.gitignore` due to size and licensing
- All data transformations are documented in the notebooks
